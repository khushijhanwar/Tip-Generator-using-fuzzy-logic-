# Tip-Generator-using-fuzzy-logic-
the categories that were considered where quality and service so if quality and service where poor then the tip is poor. If quality and service where medium that means it is a partial member that is it belongs between zero and one that is medium. If quality and service, both were hight then the tip becomes a full member which is high.
